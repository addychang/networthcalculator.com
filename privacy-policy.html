        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: April 17, 2025</p>

        <p>Welcome to NetWorthCalculator.com (the "Site"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Net Worth Calculator tool and visit our Site.</p>

        <p><strong>Our Core Privacy Principle:</strong> The financial data you enter into the Net Worth Calculator (your assets and liabilities) is processed entirely within your web browser using JavaScript. <strong>This data is NOT transmitted to our servers, NOT stored by us, and NOT shared with any third parties by us.</strong> We utilize your browser's local storage (`localStorage`) feature solely to save your inputs so you don't have to re-enter them if you revisit the calculator from the same browser. This data remains on your device and is under your control.</p>

        <h2 id="information-we-collect">1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>a) Financial Information You Provide to the Calculator</h3>
        <p>As stated above, the specific values you enter for your assets (like real estate value, bank account balances, investments) and liabilities (like mortgage balance, credit card debt, loans) are processed locally in your browser. We use `localStorage` to save this information directly on your computer or device. This allows the calculator to remember your entries between sessions for your convenience.</p>
        <p><strong>We do not have access to, collect, or store this specific financial data on our servers.</strong> Clearing your browser's cache or specifically clearing `localStorage` for this Site will remove this data from your device.</p>

        <h3>b) Automatically Collected Information (Usage Data)</h3>
        <p>Like most websites, when you visit NetWorthCalculator.com, we may automatically collect certain standard technical information sent by your browser. This may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Log Data:</strong> Your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, operating system, the pages you visit on our Site, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, and other standard web log information.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with the Site, such as which features you use (e.g., clicking the "Calculate" button), but not the specific financial values you enter.</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong> We may use cookies (small files stored on your device) or similar technologies for essential site functionality and anonymous analytics. See Section 4 for more details.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This automatically collected information is used for analytical purposes, to understand how visitors use our Site, to improve our services, and for security monitoring. This data is generally aggregated and does not personally identify you, nor does it include the specific financial figures you enter into the calculator fields.</p>

        <h2 id="how-we-use-information">2. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Operate and Maintain the Site:</strong> Ensuring the calculator functions correctly and the website is accessible.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve the Site:</strong> Analyzing usage patterns (through aggregated, anonymous data) to understand user needs and enhance the user experience, features, and content.</li>
            <li><strong>To Ensure Security:</strong> Monitoring for fraudulent or malicious activity and protecting the integrity of our Site.</li>
            <li><strong>To Comply with Legal Obligations:</strong> Fulfilling any legal or regulatory requirements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>We reiterate: We do not use the specific financial data you enter into the calculator fields for any purpose other than performing the calculation locally within your browser and saving it to your device's `localStorage` for your convenience.</strong></p>

        <h2 id="how-we-share-information">3. How We Share Information</h2>
        <p><strong>We do not sell, rent, or share the specific financial data you enter into the calculator.</strong></p>
        <p>We may share the automatically collected, non-personally identifiable Usage Data and Log Data in the following limited circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share aggregated or anonymized usage data with third-party service providers who assist us with website hosting, analytics (like Google Analytics), and security. These providers are obligated to protect the data and use it only for the services they provide to us.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or government agency).</li>
            <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If NetWorthCalculator.com is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, aggregated usage data might be transferred. We would provide notice before any personal information (if any were ever collected beyond standard logs) is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="cookies-local-storage">4. Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
        <p><strong>Local Storage (`localStorage`):</strong> As mentioned, we use your browser's `localStorage` to save the asset and liability values you enter into the calculator. This is for your convenience only. You can clear this data at any time through your browser's settings (usually found under "Clear Browsing Data," "Site Settings," or similar options).</p>
        <p><strong>Cookies:</strong> We may use cookies for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Essential Functionality:</strong> Some cookies might be necessary for the basic operation of the website.</li>
            <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We may use third-party analytics services (like Google Analytics) that use cookies to collect anonymous information about how visitors use our Site. This helps us understand traffic patterns and improve the Site. You can often opt-out of analytics tracking through browser settings or add-ons.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can control and manage cookies through your browser settings. Disabling certain cookies may affect the functionality of the Site, but the core calculator function (without saving) should still work.</p>

        <h2 id="data-security">5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement reasonable technical and administrative measures to protect the information we handle (primarily Usage Data and Log Data). However, please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>
        <p>The security of the financial data you enter into the calculator and which is stored in your browser's `localStorage` is primarily dependent on the security of your own device and browser.</p>

        <h2 id="your-data-rights">6. Your Data Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>Regarding the financial data entered into the calculator:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access & Correction:</strong> You can view and change the data directly in the calculator fields.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete the data stored in `localStorage` by clearing your browser's data for this Site or by using the "Reset" button on the calculator page, which clears the input fields and associated `localStorage` entries.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Regarding automatically collected Usage Data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You may have rights depending on your location (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) to access, correct, or request deletion of any personal information associated with your usage (like IP address logs, if considered personal information). Please contact us if you wish to make such a request.</li>
            <li>You can typically control cookies and tracking through your browser settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="childrens-privacy">7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>NetWorthCalculator.com is not intended for use by children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will take steps to delete it.</p>

        <h2 id="third-party-links">8. Third-Party Links</h2>
        <p>Our Site may contain links to other websites not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

        <h2 id="changes-to-policy">9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
